# Binary
###### A social debate network, built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting Started
Once cloning the repository, to get started type the following commands to start the Binary server.

If running the server for the first time locate the Meteor-React-Binary directory and type in, otherwise skip directly to the run command:
```
./install.sh
```
After installing the necessary node packages, start the server by typing in:
```
./run.sh
```
This should start the server and you should be able to access it through your browser by typing in the url:
```
localhost:3000
```

## Why Binary?
Binary is designed to be potentially beneficial to all sorts of people. In brief, it can be:

- **For developers.** Say you're making an app and wonder whether users would like a particular feature. Or suppose you've finally decided to settle the debate between vim and emacs. Create a topic on binary and users can vote and discuss the pros/cons!
- **For non-developers.** Debate on all sorts of topics ranging from politics (presidential elections are coming up!) to gaming. Heck you could even ask for [(shoddy) life advice](https://binary10.co/topics/iqw86XJPDuZjW3k7j).
